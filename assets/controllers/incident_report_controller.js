/*
 * THE REPORT FLOW — one page, and the little it needs a round trip to avoid.
 *
 * The flow lives on ONE ROUTE, in ONE CONTAINER (the full page, ruled direction
 * A). There is no drawer to slide, dismiss or guard any more — a page cannot be
 * thrown away by a click beside it, so this controller no longer opens, closes or
 * animates anything. What it adds is only what the server cannot do without a
 * round trip: swapping the sub-category's own field set, and the gate.
 *
 * STEP 2 IS THE CATEGORY'S OWN, AND ITS QUESTIONS COME FROM ITS BLOCKS. Choosing a
 * kind of incident swaps in that word's own folds — one per behaviour block it
 * switched on — and the money fold is ABSENT, not disabled, for a sub-category
 * that carries no money. That is the design's contract and the template enforces
 * it by rendering no money fold there at all.
 *
 * AND THE RAIL BESIDE THE FORM IS MARKED FROM THE GATE'S OWN LIST. The checklist
 * names every answer the filing still owes; it is handed the very list the footer
 * was just given, so the rail and the File control can never disagree about the
 * same form. Choosing a word swaps the rail's card with step 2's field set, for the
 * same reason both exist: a form showing one sub-category's questions beside a card
 * describing another's would be two answers to one question.
 *
 * WHAT ELSE IT DOES IS WHAT A LIST NEEDS: a fold opens and shuts, and a repeating
 * block grows and loses rows. Neither reaches the server — a fold remembers a
 * person's reading habit, not a fact about the incident.
 *
 * THE WHOLE FLOW WORKS WITHOUT THIS CONTROLLER: the category is a radio in the
 * noscript block, one row of every repeating block is in the markup, the File
 * control ships disabled and the form posts normally to the same endpoint, which
 * refuses the same omissions.
