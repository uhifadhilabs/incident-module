/**
 * THE CASE FILE'S WRITE SURFACE — everything that happens to one incident after
 * it is filed, and the place the change becomes durable.
 *
 * WHY THIS SITS BETWEEN A CONTROLLER AND {@see IncidentTransitionService}. The
 * transition service is the state machine and takes no entity manager on purpose:
 * that is what lets every rule the workflow has be asserted in a plain unit test
 * with no database. Somebody still has to write the decision down, and until this
 * class existed that somebody was the controller, holding an entity manager for a
 * single `flush()`. A screen deciding when a domain change is persisted is a
 * screen with an opinion about the domain.
 *
 * SO THE DIVISION IS: the transition service decides and stamps, this service
 * persists, and the controller authorizes and responds. A refusal never reaches
 * the flush — {@see IncidentTransitionException} is thrown before anything is
 * written, and the endpoint answers 422 with the guard's own sentence.
 *
 * ONE SERVICE FOR PARTIES, THE ASSIGNEE AND LINKS, not three. They are writes on
 * one aggregate: each is `new X($incident, …)` self-registering on the incident,
 * a timeline event, and the same flush, and none of them needs a collaborator the
 * others do not. Three one-method services would carry three copies of the event
 * helper and three answers to "when is this durable". Evidence is the deliberate
 * exception and lives in {@see IncidentEvidenceService}, because it crosses into
 * stored bytes and has a failure vocabulary of its own.
 *
 * EVERY WRITE LEAVES A TIMELINE EVENT, for the reason the timeline exists: a
 * column that changed with no trace proves nothing in a hearing. Who to print it
 * under is passed in beside the account, so the record still names them if the
 * account later goes.
