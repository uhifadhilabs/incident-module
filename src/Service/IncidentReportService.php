/**
 * FILING AN INCIDENT — the only door in.
 *
 * THE DESIGN'S OWN RULE ABOUT COST: a report is cheap and a verification is
 * expensive, and the form says so. Filing takes three short steps and almost
 * nothing is required, because a half-remembered report that EXISTS beats a
 * perfect one that was never filed. The cost is moved to verification, where
 * somebody competent is looking anyway.
 *
 * So this service asks for very little and refuses almost nothing. What it DOES
 * enforce is the handful of facts that cannot be added later without lying:
 *
 *  - **It starts at `reported`.** Every source, including an SMS from a village.
 *    There is no way to file something already verified.
 *  - **Provenance is written here or never.** A report arriving from a patrol
 *    observation is tied to it at creation
 *    ({@see Incident::recordProvenance()}), and nothing can rewrite that.
 *  - **The money record exists only where the sub-category carries money.**
 *    Absent, not empty — the detail page has no money card at all on a natural
 *    mortality.
 *  - **The first timeline event is the filing itself.** A record whose history
 *    begins after it was created cannot say who started it.
