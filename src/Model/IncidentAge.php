/**
 * HOW LONG, SAID THE WAY THIS MODULE SAYS IT.
 *
 * The design writes an age in hours up to two days and in days after that,
 * because "62 h" is a number a person converts and "3 d" is one they read. The
 * module's own `_ui.html.twig` ageing chip already draws it that way; this is
 * the same rule in PHP, for the places a host prints the module's words without
 * rendering its templates — an attention item's age label, a tile's alarm.
 *
 * ONE PLACE, because an incident that reads "17 d" on the area overview and
 * "408 h" on its own case file is two records as far as anybody reading is
 * concerned.
