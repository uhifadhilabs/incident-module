/**
 * REPORTING AN INCIDENT — what kind, what happened, where, and the defining
 * question of every block the category switched on.
 *
 * ONE CONTAINER, THE FULL PAGE (the ruled direction A, with D's quick-file
 * discipline inside it). Filing gets an ADDRESS of its own, whatever the entry
 * point:
 *
 *   FILING FROM A RECORD — another module's "file as incident" button, or the
 *   register's report control carrying context — renders the page with the source
 *   card riding at its head, so the thing being filed about is right there.
 *
 *   STANDALONE FILING — a deep link, a fresh tab, the dashboard's Report button —
 *   renders the same page with no source card.
 *
 * A page reloads, deep-links, prints, and cannot be thrown away by a click beside
 * it — which is why the slide-over drawer this flow once opened for a
 * record-borne filing is retired. There is one container and one POST, refused
 * for the same three reasons.
 *
 * STEP 2 IS THE SUB-CATEGORY'S OWN, AND ITS QUESTIONS COME FROM ITS BLOCKS. One
 * fold per behaviour block the sub-category switched on, in the order the kinds
 * editor holds them, each asking exactly what {@see BlockQuestionCatalogue} says
 * it asks. A block that is off is ABSENT — choose a natural mortality and there
 * is no money fold in the document at all. Not disabled. Absent.
 *
 * AND EVERY SWITCHED-ON BLOCK'S DEFINING ANSWER GATES THE FILING: the species,
 * one count row, the method, a party with a role and a name, a seizure item and
 * count, the figure, the condition, a sample type and reference, an injury row, a
 * measure row, the kind of place and which one, the permit and licence status. A
 * block that records nothing is worse than a block that is absent. The paperwork
 * — contacts, ID numbers, custody references, dates, facilities — never gates,
 * and the browser says all of this sooner than the endpoint without being the
 * authority for any of it ({@see IncidentBlockAnswerService}).
 *
 * ARRIVING FROM AN OBSERVATION: {@see IncidentPrefill} reads the hand-off's query
 * string. Everything it carries is a guess the filer may overrule, except the
 * provenance link, which is written once and never again.
 *
 * The permission is `incidents.record`. The design's IN·R1 card says filing needs
 * "anyone with Modules access · not a permission of its own"; a POST that CREATES
 * a record still has to be guarded by something a host can grant, so the module
 * DECLARES this permission and a deployment that agrees with the design grants it
 * to everyone who can reach the module. See `docs/permissions.md`.
 *
 * WHICH MODULE THESE ROUTES BELONG TO, said once for the class. RegistryBundle
 * owns the per-area ledger and closes a parked module's pages before any
 * controller is asked — 404, not 403, because a parked module is not withheld:
 * the area is not running it. The class-level default below is how a route tells
 * the gate whose page it is.
 *
 * WITHOUT IT THESE ROUTES ARE NOT EXEMPT, THEY ARE GUESSED AT. The gate falls
 * back to reading `/areas/{uuid}/modules/{slug}/…` and matching the segment
 * against the catalogue, which happens to land here because the segment and the
 * slug are both `incidents`. That is an accident of naming, not a contract, and
 * it would end the moment a path moved. The area's uuid is in a parameter called
 * `uuid`, which is the gate's own default, so there is no
 * `_uhifadhi_module_area` to state.
