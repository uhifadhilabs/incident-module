/**
 * THE CASE FILE'S MAP PLATE IS SIZED BY THIS SCREEN'S OWN DESIGN.
 *
 * The incident case file the design draws gives the "Where" card a 400px map and
 * lets the card end where the map ends — `.recgrid>.col>.c.plate-fill`, a flex
 * column whose viewer is `flex:none;height:400px`. Sizing
 * a screen against a sibling module's screen instead of against its own design
 * is how a port drifts while every test stays green, so the rule is asserted
 * here against what the design file carries.
 *
 * A TEXT CHECK, and that is the limit of what it promises: it catches the plate
 * being sized to something other than the design, not a plate that renders
 * wrongly for some other reason. Rendered fidelity is a sweep, not a unit test.
 *
 * THE HEIGHT IS STATED ON THE PLATE ROOT, which is the only thing about a map
 * this module says. It sizes the plate, not the imagery, so it is the sum of the
 * imagery the design draws and what the plate stacks above it — each part named,
 * so 400px of design is 400px of map rather than 400px of plate. The plate's column, its imagery frame, its floating legend
 * and its fullscreen are the atlas's; a module that restated any of them would
 * be the one map in the product that reads differently.
 *
 * THE CARD IS THE PLATE'S SIZE. It leads a column of cards, so it is as tall as
 * what it holds without saying anything about alignment: an `align-self` here
 * would read across the column's other axis and shrink the card off the width it
 * shares with the cards under it.
