/**
 * FILING AN INCIDENT, over HTTP.
 *
 * The design's own economics are the thing under test: a report is CHEAP and a
 * verification is EXPENSIVE. What makes the record what it is files an incident —
 * a kind, one line saying what happened, a place, and the defining question of
 * every block the category switches on — and the paperwork is offered on the
 * record afterwards.
 *
 * ONE CONTAINER, WHATEVER THE ENTRY POINT — the ruled direction (A, the full
 * page, with D's quick-file discipline inside it). A filing gets an ADDRESS: it
 * survives a reload, a dropped connection, a second tab and a pasted link, it
 * prints, and no click beside it can throw a half-written report away. The
 * slide-over drawer the module used to open when a filing arrived from a record
 * is retired; a filing FROM a record renders the same full page, with the source
 * card riding at its head. Both entry points render the same step partials, gate
 * the same answers, and post to the same endpoint.
